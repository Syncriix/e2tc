## The Cluster: A Symphony of Servers
Our setup is a delicate dance of servers, each playing a crucial role in the grand performance:
- **Ingress**: The gatekeeper. All traffic flows through this single server, giving us unparalleled control and visibility. It's our panopticon, our all-seeing eye.
- **High Availability (HA) Nodes**: Because uptime is a religion, and we're devout believers. Is it overkill? Perhaps. But in the pursuit of learning and pushing boundaries, there's no such thing as too much.
- **K3s**: Kubernetes, but leaner, meaner. This is where our applications live, each in their own perfectly orchestrated container.
