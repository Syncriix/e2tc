# Exquisite: The Bleeding Edge of Infrastructure
> #### **ex·quis·ite** */ikˈskwizit/* (adjective): 
> extremely beautiful, delicate, or carefully made.

In the realm of technology, there's a fine line between the bleeding edge and the cutting edge. The cutting edge is where the safe players reside, but the bleeding edge? That's where the magic happens. That's where boundaries are pushed, where conventions are shattered, and where true innovation is born. Welcome to Exquisite (xqis.it) - our lab setup where we dance and cut ourselves on that razor's edge.
## The Cluster: A Symphony of Servers
Our setup is a delicate dance of servers, each playing a crucial role in the grand performance:
- **Ingress**: The gatekeeper. All traffic flows through this single server, giving us unparalleled control and visibility. It's our panopticon, our all-seeing eye.
- **High Availability (HA) Nodes**: Because uptime is a religion, and we're devout believers. Is it overkill? Perhaps. But in the pursuit of learning and pushing boundaries, there's no such thing as too much.
- **K3s**: Kubernetes, but leaner, meaner. This is where our applications live, each in their own perfectly orchestrated container.
